# ME639 â€” Introduction to Robotics

This repository hosts **ongoing tutorials and resources** for the ME639 *Introduction to Robotics* course. The goal is to provide students with **hands-on demonstrations** that bridge theoretical concepts with practical applications, using tools like **MuJoCo** for simulation and experimentation.

Maintainers: **@Debojit-D** and **@Aarav2708**
Course Instructor: **@madhuvadali**

## ðŸ“˜ Tutorials

### Tutorial 1 â€” *Building and Interacting with a Simple MuJoCo World*

* Create a minimal simulation world with gravity and a ground plane.
* Spawn and configure a cuboid with mass and a freejoint.
* Load and visualize models in Python.
* Apply external forces to objects through sites.

*(See `tutorials/tutorial_1/` for XML and Python code.)*

## ðŸš§ Ongoing Development

This repository is **actively maintained** and will grow with more tutorials as the course progresses. Each tutorial will focus on practical aspects of roboticsâ€”ranging from kinematics and control to simulation and real-world integration.

Stay tuned for:

* **Tutorial 2**: (to be announced)
* **Tutorial 3**: (to be announced)

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

These tutorials are designed to support **TA hours and classroom sessions**, helping students:

* Reinforce concepts learned in lectures.
* Experiment with robotics frameworks in practice.
* Gain intuition through interactive simulation exercises.
